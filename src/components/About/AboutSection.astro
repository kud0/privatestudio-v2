    heading: "A DREAM BORN FROM FRIENDSHIP",
    text: "At AMIRO Barbershop, it all starts with friendship. Over 20 years ago, two kids, Andrea Amighetti and Luca Rossi, sat next to each other in a classroom, unknowingly sharing a dream. What began as a simple bond grew into something more a lifelong passion for the art of barbering. After years of living in different countries and following our separate paths, we reunited to bring that dream to ."
